Overview

1.1

General

1.1.1

This Document

1.1.1.a

The Altered Complete Rules is an expert document meant to resolve
the thornier cases that can occur when cards interact in unexpected ways. They
are not meant to learn the rules of Altered.

1.1.1.b

It is not expected that players know the content of this document.
However, reading the first section and particularly Subsection 1.4 “Golden Rules”
should help solve most questions.

1.1.1.c

Each numbered paragraph from Section 2 “Objects” onwards is a

rule.

1.1.1.d

The first section of this document is an informal summary of the
rules. From Section 2 “Objects” onward, each numbered paragraph is a rule.

1.1.1.e

Remarks and examples, written in italics are not rules. They are
meant to clarify the meaning of the rules.

1.1.2
1.1.2.a

Scope
These rules apply to any two-player game of Altered.

1.1.2.b

If other oﬀicial documents contradict these rules, the other documents take precedence.

1.1.3

Collectible Card Game

1.1.3.a

Altered is a collectible card game: players do not play with cards
from a common pool, but from their own collection.

1.1.3.b

In order to play a game of Altered, each player needs a deck of
Altered cards (not to be confused with the Deck zone during play).

7

1.1.3.c

For the purpose of the rules, a player is the owner of the cards in
their deck, regardless of legal ownership. Nothing in the game can change the
owner of a card.

1.1.3.d

In the course of a game of Altered, a player may gain control over
cards of their opponents. This does not change the owner of the card.

1.1.4

Constructed Play

1.1.4.a

In constructed play, a player uses Altered cards from their collection
to build their deck.

1.1.4.b

A constructed deck must include exactly 1 Hero.

1.1.4.c

A constructed deck must include at least 39 other cards.

1.1.4.d

A constructed deck can only include cards of the same faction as its

Hero.

1.1.4.e

A constructed deck can include at most 3 cards with the same name.

Remark.
In Altered, contrary to many other collectible card games,
cards with the same name may have different characteristics, rarity, and
faction. A player in a constructed event should make clear which version
of a card they play. See Figure 1 for an example

1.1.4.f

A constructed deck can include at most 15 rare (

1.1.4.g

A constructed deck can include at most 3 unique (

1.1.5

) cards.
) cards.

Limited Play

1.1.5.a

In limited play, players must build their deck from a restricted pool of
cards provided to them for a specific event, plus any number of Mana Convergence.

A limited deck can include at most 1 Hero.

1.1.5.c

A limited deck must include at least 29 non-Hero cards.

1.1.5.d

A limited deck can include cards from at most 3 factions; if that
deck include a Hero, that Hero’s faction counts as one of the three.
Remark. Limited decks have no restrictions in terms of name or rarity.

1.1.6

Numbers and Symbols

1.1.6.a

When the game uses a number, it is always an integer.

1.1.6.b

If an event requires a division, it will specify whether to round up

or down.

1.1.6.c

If an event would need to divide a number by 0, that event cannot

happen.

1.1.6.d

If a calculation uses a missing number (e.g. the statistics of a nonCharacter card), it uses zero instead.

1.1.6.e

The symbol j means “When I join the Expedition zone or the
Landmark zone l”.

1.1.6.f

The symbol h means “When I am played from Hand l”.

1.1.6.g

The symbol r means “When I am played from Reserve l”.

1.1.6.h

The symbol T means “Exhaust me”.

1.1.6.i

The symbol D means “Discard me from Reserve”.

10

1.1.6.j
The symbol I precedes a support ability (an ability that works only
in Reserve) which is a Reaction ability or a passive ability.
1.1.6.k

A white [number] in a black or yellow circle (1, 2, …) in a cost
means “Pay [that number] mana”.

1.1.7

Material

1.1.7.a

Each player starts the game with a deck of Altered cards. They
should be oﬀicially printed Altered cards with a valid QR code pointing to https:
//www.altered.gg. For the purpose of the rules, the text of an Altered card is
the English text appearing on the Altered website. Note that the text appearing
on the physical card may differ, if the card is printed in a different language or
without text. It may also have received errata.

1.1.7.b

Tokens are used to represent objects that are created by the game,
but do not have a corresponding Altered card. Players must have a way to represent the tokens that their deck can create in a way that makes clear their characteristics and status. It is possible, but not mandatory, to use the oﬀicial tokens
published by Equinox. For rules purposes, tokens are cards and the owner of a
token is the player who created it.

1.1.7.c

Counters are markers put on cards by events in the game. Players
should have a way of representing counters which make clear which counters are
on which objects. Counters with the same name are indistinguishable.

1.1.7.d

If a player’s deck has cards that ask them to “roll a die”, they should
have fair six-sided dice numbered from 1 to 6.

1.1.7.e

Players should have a way to represent the status of their objects
in all visible zones. The exhausted status is usually represented by turning the
representation of the object from a vertical to an horizontal direction (a nonexhausted object is ready). Other statuses may be represented by printed or
colored markers.

1.1.7.f

Between the two of them, players need a Hero Region Card, a Companion Region Card, and three different Tumult cards (one V |MO, one M |VO,
and one O |VM) to represent the Adventure.

Game Concepts

1.2.1

Players

1.2.1.a

A player is a participant in a game of Altered.

1.2.1.b

In a two-player game, each player is the other’s opponent.

1.2.1.c

Each player in a game of Altered needs to have their own deck.

1.2.1.d

Each player has a number of personal zones in the game: Deck,
Discard pile, Hand, Hero zone, Landmark zone, Mana zone, and Reserve.

1.2.2

Objects

1.2.2.a

Objects are the game pieces of Altered.

1.2.2.b

Most things in a game of Altered are either objects, properties of
objects or sets of objects.

1.2.2.c

Objects have characteristics:

• Type (Character, Emblem, Hero, Permanent, Region, Spell)
• Sub-type
• Name
• Rarity (common

, rare

, unique

)

• Version
• Hand Cost
• Reserve Cost
• Faction (Axiom

, Bravos

, Lyra

, Muna

• Statistics (one number for each of V, M, O)
• Abilities

12

, Ordis

, Yzmir

)

• Reserve limit (only for Heroes)
• Landmark limit (only for Heroes)
• Duration (only for Emblems)

1.2.2.d
1.2.3
1.2.3.a

An object may lack some of these characteristics.

Zones
Zones are the game board of Altered. They are sets of cards or

objects.

1.2.3.b

There are ten kind of zones (Adventure, Deck, Discard pile, Expedition zone, Hand, Hero zone, Landmark zone, Limbo, Mana zone, Reserve).

1.2.3.c

The Expedition zone is split into four sub-zones called Expeditions:
one Hero Expedition and one Companion Expedition for each player. In a 2-player
game, the two Hero Expeditions (one for each player) are facing each other, as well
as the two Companion Expeditions.

1.2.3.d

Three zones are shared: Adventure, Expedition zone, Limbo. There
is only one of each in a game of Altered.

1.2.3.e

The seven other zones are personal. Each player has their own Deck,
Discard pile, Hand, Hero zone, Landmark zone, Mana zone, and Reserve.

1.2.3.f

Eight zones are visible: Adventure, Discard pile, Expedition zone,
Hero zone, Landmark zone, Limbo, Mana zone and Reserve. They contain objects;
players can know their number and characteristics of all objects in these zones at
all time.

1.2.3.g

The two other zones are hidden: Deck, and Hand. They contain
cards; players can know the number of cards in each of these zones at all time.

1.2.4
1.2.4.a

Abilities
Each paragraph in the textbox of an object is a separate ability.

13

1.2.4.b

Some abilities are represented by keywords. Several keywords, representing different abilities, may appear the same line.

1.2.4.c

There are four types of abilities:

• Quick actions are written “Cost: Effect”. Players may play any number of
quick actions in their turn before playing a card or passing.
• Reactions are written “Trigger l Effect” or “Effect after trigger”. When an
event activates the trigger, the Effect resolves.
• Passive abilities are written as statements. Passive abilities may modify
rules, events, or the characteristics of objects.
• Effects are written as changes to the game state. When an effect resolves,
these changes are applied.

1.2.4.d

Abilities of non-Hero objects only work when that object is in play
(i.e. in the Expedition zone, or the Landmark zone) unless it specifies that it works
in another zone. Furthermore:
• Abilities of Heroes only work in the Hero zone;
• Support abilities only work in Reserve, and only when the object is ready;
• Abilities of Emblems only work in Limbo;
• Abilities of an object that say that it can be played from a specific zone
work in that zone;
• Abilities of an object that change the way it may be played, e.g. by changing
its cost, work in any zone from which that object can be played.

1.2.5

Costs

1.2.5.a

A cost is a change to the game state that a player can do in order
to do something, e.g. playing a card or a quick action.

1.2.5.b
A player is never forced to pay a cost. Not paying a cost may
preclude certain game actions, such as playing a card, or have some things happen
or not happen.

14

1.2.5.c

Costs must always be paid in full. If a player cannot pay part of a
cost, they cannot pay the cost at all.

1.2.5.d

All parts in a single cost are always paid simultaneously.

1.2.5.e

A mana cost is payed by exhausting that many Mana Orbs.

1.2.6

Effects

1.2.6.a

An effect is a change to the game state that happens during the
resolution of a spell, a quick action, a Reaction, a daily effect, or a turn effect.

1.2.6.b

Effects may have several steps. There is usually one step for each
verb in an effect, unless these verbs are said to happen simultaneously.

1.2.6.c

Some steps use the word “target”. A target is an object, player,
Expedition or zone that the controller of the effect chooses as it resolves.

1.2.6.d

Steps are usually mandatory. Optional steps use the word “may”.

1.2.6.e

Some steps are conditional. They are written “If [condition], do
[step]”. Conditional steps whose condition is not met are ignored.

1.2.6.f

If part of an effect cannot happen, that part is ignored, but the rest
of the effect happens normally.

1.2.7

Events

1.2.7.a

An event is a change from one game state to the next.

1.2.7.b

Paying a cost is always a single event.

1.2.7.c

There is a different event for each step in the resolution of an effect.

15

1.2.7.d

Some events involve no change in the game state, for example if they
act on an empty set of objects or if they only provide information to one or both
players.

1.3

Game Progress

1.3.1

Starting the Game

1.3.1.a

The players build a common Adventure with the Hero Region card
on one end, the Companion Region card on the other, and three face-down Tumult cards in random positions and orientations between the Hero Region and the
Companion Region.

1.3.1.b

Each player’s hero Expedition counter is put on the Hero Region,
and each player’s companion Expedition counter is put on the Companion Region.

1.3.1.c

Each player puts their Hero (if they have one) in their Hero zone,
shuffles the rest of their cards and puts it in their Deck.

1.3.1.d

The first player of the first day is determined at random.

1.3.1.e

In the Morning of the first day, instead of the normal daily effects,
players draw six cards and put three of them ready in their Mana zone.

1.3.2
1.3.2.a

Day Progress
Each day is divided into five phases.

1.3.2.b

In the Morning phase, the opponent of the first player becomes the
first player (Succeed), players ready their Heroes, Characters, Permanents, Mana
Orbs, and cards in Reserve (Prepare), draw two cards (Draw) and may put one
card from their Hand in their Mana zone as a ready Mana Orb (Expand).

1.3.2.c

In the Noon phase, nothing happens unless one or more Reactions
trigger “At Noon”.

16

1.3.2.d

In the Afternoon phase, starting with the first player, players alternate taking turns until both have passed; during their turn, a player may play any
number of quick actions and then either play a card or pass; once a player has
passed, they cannot take more turns this day.

1.3.2.e

In the Dusk phase, players sum up the statistics of all the characters
in each of their Expeditions. An Expedition moves forward if one of its statistics
is:
• one of its terrains;
• (strictly) greater than the corresponding statistic of the Expedition facing
it;
• (strictly) greater than zero.

1.3.2.f

In the Night phase, Characters in the Expedition zone and Gears
that belonged in an Expedition that moved forward this day return to the Reserve
(Rest). Extra cards in Reserve are discarded, and extra cards in Landmark zone
are sacrificed (Clean-up). Finally, we check if a player has won the game (Check
Victory), as described in the following section.

1.3.3

Ending the Game

1.3.3.a

During Check Victory, before starting a new day, check if at least
one player’s hero Expedition and companion Expedition have met or crossed each
other.

1.3.3.b

At that point, count the distance between each Expedition and its
starting Region. If the total distance of one player’s Expeditions is greater than
their opponent’s, that player wins the game.

1.3.3.c

Otherwise, tiebreakers start: all regions in the Adventure are immediately replaced by the Arena (on the back of the Companion card).

1.3.3.d

During tiebreakers, all Expeditions are in the Arena, and the statistics of all Characters are summed up during Dusk.

1.3.3.e

Players play new days until one of them, during Dusk, wins on more
terrains than their opponent. When that happens, they win the game.

17

1.3.3.f

Tiebreakers may last for several days.

1.4

Golden Rules

1.4.1

Can’t Beats Can

1.4.1.a

If a rule or a passive ability says that it is impossible to do something,
and a cost or an effect tries to do that thing, then the thing cannot be done.

1.4.1.b

An impossible cost cannot be paid.

1.4.1.c

An impossible effect cannot be performed. If other parts of the effect
can happen, the rest of the effect resolves normally.

1.4.1.d

It is impossible to modify an impossible event, even if the modified
event would itself be possible.

1.4.2

Specific Beats General

1.4.2.a

If a card allows a player to do something that they cannot normally
do, or to do it in a different way, the card takes priority.

1.4.3

My Cards, My Zones

1.4.3.a

If a card owned by a player would move to a zone belonging to
another player, it goes to its owner’s corresponding zone instead.

1.4.4

New Zone, New Object

1.4.4.a

Objects do not change zones, the items that represent them does.
Anything that relates to an object in a zone will not be able to follow it to another
zone, except for the event which moves an object.

1.4.5

Initiative Order

18

1.4.5.a

If both players need to take decisions simultaneously, the player with
initiative (the player who is currently taking their turn or the first player during
non-Afternoon phases) must decide first. If that choice involves an object from a
visible zone, their opponent knows which object they have chosen. If the choice
involves a card from a hidden zone, they must make their choice explicit, but they
do not need to reveal the chosen card.
Example.
Ninette plays a game against Lithium. During her turn,
Ninette plays
Kitsune
from her Hand. Kitsune has the Reaction
“h Each player may Resupply”. She must let Lithium know whether or
not she chooses to Resupply before he takes his decision. However, if she
chooses to Resupply, Lithium will not see Ninette’s top card until after
he decides whether to Resupply or not.
In his turn, Lithium plays
Anubis , which has the Reaction “j Each
player sacrifices a Character”. Lithium must choose which Character to
sacrifice before Ninette, and Ninette knows which Character he chose to
sacrifice when she makes her choice. Both Characters are sacrificed simultaneously.

1.4.6

Nothing Is Forever

1.4.6.a

The interaction of some cards may lead to seemingly endless loops.
In order to resolve these situations, there are limits to the number of times things
can happen in a single day.

1.4.6.b

A single quick action of any given object may only be played up to
a hundred times per day.

1.4.6.c

A single Reaction of any given object may only activate up to a
hundred times per day.

1.4.7

Who Did That?

1.4.7.a

Some triggers and Passive abilities depend on which player did a
specific action. When that action happens as part of an event, look at the first
matching criteria to determine who did that action:

19

1.4.7.b

Some effects specify which player does the action.

1.4.7.c

The controller of the effect is the one who does the action.

1.4.7.d

The controller of the affected object is the one who does the action.

1.4.7.e

Neither player did the action.

20

2

Objects

2.1

General

2.1.a

Objects exist in every visible zone. Each object belongs to a single
zone at any given time.

2.1.b

Objects can be represented in different ways: Altered cards, token
cards, Adventure cards, halves of Tumult cards, and emblems.

2.1.c

Objects never change zones. However, many rules and effects are
worded as if they did.

2.1.d
When a cost or an effect “moves” an object to a different zone, it
moves the item representing that object, which becomes a new object with a new
timestamp if it ends up in a visible zone. Nothing relating to the old object applies
to the new one, except for the exceptions listed in rule 2.1.f . The old object is
considered to not exist from that point, except for Reactions that may reference
it.
Example. Lithium has
Haven, Bravos Bastion
and plays
Kuwat, the Dissenter
from Reserve. This triggers the two Reactions
of Kuwat, its native “j Sacrifice a Character” and the one granted by
Haven “r I gain 1 boost”. If Lithium decide to play the j Reaction first
and to sacrifice Kuwat, then the r Reaction will not boost Kuwat in the
Discard pile as it is not the same object as Kuwat in the Expedition zone
which triggered the r reaction.

2.1.e
If a token would leave the Expedition zone and join another zone, it
does not join its new zone and simultaneously ceases to exist instead (it still leaves
the Expedition zone).
2.1.f

If an ability refers to a card or an object moving from any zone to a
visible zone (as part of a cost, a trigger, or an effect), that ability can find the new
object in its destination zone. This is an exception to Rule 2.1.d.

21

Example.
Moonlight Jellyfish
has the Reaction “When I am
sacrificed, if I was not Fleeting l Put me in Reserve”. If Moonlight Jellyfish
is sacrificed, its Reaction triggers and is able to find the Moonlight Jellyfish
in the Discard pile even though it is a different object than the one whose
Reaction just triggered.

2.1.g

Rule 2.1.f can apply through more than one zone change, as long as
they all come from the ability itself.
Example.
Coppélia
has the Reaction “When I go to Reserve
from your Hand l You may play me for free and I gain Asleep”. Coppélia
in Reserve, Coppélia in Limbo, and Coppélia in the Expedition zone are
three different objects, but the effect of Coppélia’s reaction in Reserve can
act on the two other Coppélias as it is that effect that moved the card from
Reserve to Limbo and to the Expedition zone.

2.1.h

In some cases, an effect may be asking for information about an object
that does not exist anymore. Such effects use the information that was true about
that object just before it ceased to exist.
Remark. A Character which moved from one Expedition to another did
not leave the Expedition zone. If an effect asks for information about such
a Character, it uses the current information of that Character in its new
Expedition.

2.1.i

An object that does not exist anymore cannot move to a new zone or
Expeditions.

2.1.j

Cards in hidden zones are not objects.

2.1.k

Zones are not objects: they are sets of objects or cards.

2.1.l

Counters are not objects: they are markers placed on objects.

22

2.2

Characteristics

2.2.1

Type

2.2.1.a

A type is one of the following: Character, Emblem, Hero, Mana Orb,
Permanent, Region, Spell.

2.2.1.b

Each object has a single type.

2.2.1.c

The type of an Altered card is written on the type line, just below
the name of the card. It is the first word of the type line, before the dash.

2.2.1.d

The type of a token card is Character.

Remark. The tokens printed by Equinox have the word “Token” in their
type line. This is for clarity and has no rules implications.

2.2.1.e

The type of an object represented by an Adventure card or half a
Tumult card is Region.

2.2.1.f

The type of an object represented by a face-down card in the Mana
zone is Mana Orb.

2.2.1.g

The type of an emblem is Emblem.

Remark. The type Emblem does not appear on cards. It is reserved for
temporary objects in Limbo created by Reactions or effects whose impact
on the game lasts longer than their own resolution.

2.2.1.h

When a cost or an effect refers to “a [type]”, it refers to an object
in play with the appropriate type, unless it specifies a specific zone.

23

Example.
Banishing Gate
has the effect “Discard target Character or Permanent”. When that Spell is played, its controller must choose
a Character or Permanent in play. They cannot choose a Character or
Permanent from another zone, such as the Reserve.

2.2.1.i

When a cost or an effect checks whether a specific card or object is
“a [type]”, it checks whether that card or that object has the appropriate type,
regardless of its location.
Example.
Ada Lovelace
has the Reaction “r You may put a
card from your hand in Reserve. If it’s a Permanent, draw a card”. If a
player chooses to put a Permanent card in Reserve during the resolution
of this Reaction, they draw a card.

2.2.2

Sub-types

2.2.2.a

Characters, Spells, Permanents, Regions, and Emblems may have

sub-types.

2.2.2.b

Heroes have no sub-types.

2.2.2.c

An object may have any number of sub-types.

2.2.2.d

The list of Character sub-types is: Adventurer, Animal, Apprentice,
Artist, Bureaucrat, Citizen, Companion, Deity, Dragon, Druid, Elemental, Engineer, Fairy, Leviathan, Mage, Messenger, Noble, Plant, Robot, Soldier, Scholar,
Spirit, Titan, Trainer.

2.2.2.e

The list of Permanent sub-types is: Construction, Gear, Site.

2.2.2.f

The list of region sub-types is: Forest (V), Mountain (M), Water

(O).

24

2.2.2.g

The list of spell sub-types is: Boon, Conjuration, Disruption, Ma-

neuver, Song.

2.2.2.h

The list of emblem sub-types is: Reaction, Ongoing.

2.2.2.i

The sub-types of an Altered card are written on the type line, just
below the name of the card. They are to the right of the dash; if there is more
than one sub-type, they are separated by commas.

2.2.2.j

The sub-types of a token are defined by the effect that creates it.
They are written after the statistics of the token, separated by commas.
Example. Foundry Armorer has the r ability “ Create a Brassbug
2/2/2 Robot token in target Expedition”. The sub-type of the token created
when this reaction resolves is “Robot”.

2.2.2.k

The sub-types of the Hero region, Companion region, and the arena
are Forest (V), Mountain (M), and Water (O).
Remark.
types.

Regions represented by face-down Tumult cards have no sub-

2.2.2.l

The sub-types of regions represented face-up Tumult cards are described by symbols on the side of the regions.

2.2.2.m

The sub-type of an emblem created as a Reaction triggers is Reaction. The sub-type of an emblem created by an effect that lasts longer than its
own resolution is Ongoing.
Example.
Aloe Vera
has the reaction “At Noon l Resupply”. As
the Noon phase begins, Aloe Vera’s controller creates an Emblem-Reaction
in Limbo with the text “Resupply”. When that Reaction is played, its
effect resolves, then it ceases to exist.

25

Example.
Celebration Day
has the effect “Expeditions can´t
move forward this Day”. When that effect resolves, an Emblem-Ongoing is
created in Limbo with the passive ability “Expeditions can’t move forward”
and the duration “this Day”.

2.2.2.n

When a cost or an effect refers to “a sub-type”, it refers to an object
in play with the appropriate sub-type.

2.2.2.o

When a cost or an effect checks whether a specific card or object
is “a [sub-type]”, it checks whether that card or that object has the appropriate
sub-type, regardless of its location.

2.2.2.p

Some effects have objects gain or lose types. These effects actually
mean gaining or losing sub-types.
Example.
The Kraken
has the ability “All regions are O and
lose their other types”. When the Kraken is in play, regions keep the type
Region and lose the V and M sub-types.

2.2.3

Zone Type

2.2.3.a

Permanents have a zone type.

2.2.3.b

A zone type is either Expedition or Landmark

2.2.3.c

The zone type of a Permanent is written on the type line, just below
the name of the card, before the “Permanent” type.

2.2.3.d

When an Expedition Permanent card resolves, it joins one of the
Expeditions of its controller.

2.2.3.e

When a Landmark Permanent card resolves, it joins the Landmark
zone of its controller.

26

2.2.4

Name

2.2.4.a

The name of an object is a series of words and symbols.

2.2.4.b

An object has only one name, even if it contains several words.

2.2.4.c

The name of an object is its English name, even if it is represented
by a card printed in a different language.
Example.
Fée Clochette
is the French version of
Tinker
Bell . The name of an object represented by that card is Tinker Bell.

2.2.4.d

The name of an object represented by a Permanent card is written
in the middle of the card, below the rarity gem and above the type line.

2.2.4.e

The name of an object represented by a non-Permanent card is
written on the top of the card, below the rarity gem.
Remark. Cards with the same name may have different characteristics,
if they have different raritys, different factions, or they are unique.

2.2.4.f

The name of a token is defined by the effect that creates it. It is
composed of the words written before its statistics.
Example.
Ordis Cadets
has the reaction “j Create an Ordis
Recruit 1/1/1 Soldier token in my Expedition”. The name of the token
created when this Reaction resolves is “Ordis Recruit”.

2.2.4.g
2.2.5

Emblems have no name.

Rarity

27

2.2.5.a

The rarity of an object is one of the following: common, rare, or

unique.

2.2.5.b

The rarity of a card is indicated by a gem just above the card’s
name. A gray gem
indicates a common card; a blue gem
indicates a rare
card (faction-shifted cards are considered rare); an orange gem
indicates a
unique card. It is also written as a letter (C, R, F, or U) on the legal line at the
bottom of the card.

2.2.5.c
2.2.6

Heroes, regions, tokens, and emblems have no rarity.

Version

2.2.6.a

The version of an object is a code of the form: LLL-NNN-L(-NNNN),
where the L’s are letters and the N’s are numbers.

2.2.6.b

The letters before the first dash correspond to the set release.

Example. The three letters BTG stand for the set “Beyond the Gates”.

2.2.6.c

The next three numbers are the number of the card in the set.

2.2.6.d
(

The single letter is the rarity of the card, which can be C for commom
), R for rare (
), F for faction-shifted (
), or U for unique (
).

2.2.6.e

Unique cards have four extra numbers.

2.2.6.f

Each unique card has a different version number.

2.2.6.g

In the Beyond the Gates set, different cards may share the same
number if one comes from the Kickstarter release and the other one from the
Retail release. They may be distinguished by a stylized A on the bottom left of
the card.

2.2.7

Hand Cost
28

2.2.7.a

The Hand Cost of an object is a number.

2.2.7.b

The Hand Cost of an Altered card is written as a number in a circle
on the top left of the card, just above and to the left of the Reserve Cost.

2.2.7.c

Tokens have a hand cost of 0.

2.2.7.d

Emblems have no hand cost.

2.2.8

Reserve Cost

2.2.8.a

The Reserve Cost of an object is a number.

2.2.8.b

The Reserve Cost of an Altered card is written as a number in a
circle on the top left of the card, just below and to the right of the Hand Cost.

2.2.8.c

Tokens have a reserve cost of 0.

2.2.8.d

Emblems have no reserve cost.

2.2.9

Faction

2.2.9.a

A faction is one of the following: Axiom, Bravos, Lyra, Muna, Ordis,

Yzmir.

2.2.9.b

Some objects have no faction. They are called neutral.

2.2.9.c

The faction of an object represented by a card is defined by its faction
symbol and its background color.
• Axiom:

, brown

• Bravos:

, red

• Lyra:

, pink

• Muna:

, green

29

• Ordis:

, blue

• Yzmir:

, purple

2.2.9.d

Tokens and Emblems have no faction.

Remark. The token cards printed by Equinox have a background color
and a faction symbol. This is purely for aesthetic reasons and has no rules
implications.

2.2.10

Statistics

2.2.10.a

Statistics are numbers.

2.2.10.b

There are three statistics: Forest (V), Mountain (M), and Water

(O).

2.2.10.c

Only Characters have statistics.

2.2.10.d

The statistics of a Character card are represented on the left of the
card, with V on top and in green, M in the middle and in orange, and O on the
bottom and in blue.

2.2.10.e

The statistics of a token are defined by the effect that creates it.
They are written between the name and the sub-types of the token, separated
by forward slashes, with the V statistic first, the M statistic second, and the O
statistic third.
Example. Kojo & Booda has the reaction “At Noon, if you are the first
player l Create a Booda 2/2/2 Companion token in your companion
Expedition”. The statistics of this token are 2, 2, and 2.

2.2.11

Abilities

30

2.2.11.a

Abilities are either quick actions, Reactions, passive abilities, or

effects.

2.2.11.b

The abilities of an object represented by an Altered card are written
in the ability box, below the illustration.

2.2.11.c

Text in italics in the ability box has no existence rules-wise.

2.2.11.d
Some abilities are written in a box inside the ability box with a
colored background and white or yellow text. Such abilities are support abilities.
Example. The textbox of
Haven Trainee
has the following text:
r I gain two boosts.
“All right, lad, show me what you’ve learned.”
D: The next Character you play this turn gains 1 boost. (Discard me from
Reserve to do this.)
Haven Trainee (rare) has a two abilities: “r I gain two boosts.” and “D:
The next Character you play this turn gains 1 boost.”. The first one is an
in play ability and the second one is a support ability. “All right, lad, show
me what you’ve learned.” is flavor text and “(Discard me from Reserve to
do this.)” is reminder text.

2.2.11.e

Support abilities which are Reactions or passive abilities are preceded by the I symbol.

2.2.11.f

The abilities of a Character represented by a token are defined by
the effect that creates it. They are written between quotation marks and preceded
by “with”, after the location in which the token is created.
Example. Lindiwe & Maw has the quick action “T: Create a Maw
0/0/0 Companion token in your companion Expedition with “When you
sacrifice a Character l I gain two boosts”. This action costs mana1 more
if you are not the first player”. The token created by this quick action has
the Reaction “When you sacrifice a Character l I gain two boosts”.

31

2.2.11.g
Unless otherwise specified, the abilities of an object only work while
this object is in play.
2.2.11.h

Abilities of Heroes only work in the Hero zone.

2.2.11.i

Support abilities only work in Reserve.

2.2.11.j

Exhausted objects in Reserve have no support abilities.

2.2.11.k

Quick actions are written “Cost: Effect”.

Remark.
Some quick actions use symbols as part of their costs: T
means “Exhaust me” and D means “Discard me from Reserve”. See 7.1.4
“Cost symbols”.

2.2.11.l

Reactions are written “Trigger l Effect”.

Remark. Some reactions use symbols as triggers: j means “When I
join the Expedition zone or the Landmark zone l”; h means “When I am
played from Hand l”; r means “When I am played from Reserve l”. See
7.1.1 “Trigger symbols”.

2.2.11.m

Passive abilities are written as statements. They may create or
alter rules, change the characteristics of objects, or modify the way costs and effects
affect the game.

2.2.11.n
2.2.12

Effects are written as instructions to change the game state.

Reserve Limit

2.2.12.a

The reserve limit is a number.

2.2.12.b

Only Heroes have a reserve limit.

32

2.2.12.c

The reserve limit of a Hero is represented by a number of rectangles
on a line below the illustration and above the ability box, to the left of that Hero’s
faction symbol.
Remark. If a player does not have a Hero, the default reserve limit is 2
(see Rule 3.2.10.b).

2.2.13

Landmark Limit

2.2.13.a

The landmark limit is a number.

2.2.13.b

Only Heroes have a landmark limit.

2.2.13.c

The landmark limit of a Hero is represented by a number of rectangles on a line below the illustration and above the ability box, to the right of
that Hero’s faction symbol.
Remark. If a player does not have a Hero, the default landmark limit
is 2 (see Rule 3.2.7.b).

2.2.14

Duration

2.2.14.a

A duration is either “this turn”, “this Afternoon”, or “this Day”.

2.2.14.b

Only Ongoing Emblems have a duration.

2.2.14.c

The duration of an Ongoing Emblem is defined by the event that

created it.

33

Example.
Twinkle Twinkle
has the support ability “D: The
next card you play this turn costs 1 less”. When its effect resolves, its
controller creates an Ongoing Emblem in Limbo with the passive ability
“The next card you play costs 1 less” and the duration “this turn”. When
the current turn ends, this Ongoing Emblem ceases to exist, whether its
controller has played a card or not.

2.2.14.d

An Emblem with a duration of “this turn” can only be created

during a turn.

2.2.14.e

An Emblem with a duration of “this Afternoon” can only be created
during Morning, Noon, or Afternoon. If it is created dunring Morning or Noon, it
will expire at the end of that day’s Afternoon.

2.2.15

Timestamp

2.2.15.a

A timestamp is a number.

2.2.15.b

Whenever an object enters a new zone or is created in a zone, it
receives a new timestamp.

2.2.15.c

Each timestamp is greater than all previous timestamps.

2.2.15.d

If multiple objects would receive timestamps at the same time, the
first player in initiative order first chooses the relative order of the timestamps for
their objects, then their opponent does the same.

2.3

Applying Passive Abilities

2.3.1

Base Characteristics

2.3.1.a

A card object represented by a card has the base characteristics
written on the card. Some cards may have received errata since their publication.

34

2.3.1.b

An object represented by a token has the base characteristics described by the event that created the token.

2.3.1.c

An object may be missing one or more characteristics.

2.3.1.d

If an object does not have a characteristic, this characteristic cannot

be modified.

2.3.1.e

If an object does not have a characteristic, this characteristic can be

gained.

2.3.1.f

If an event looks for the value of an absent characteristic, it uses zero
for numeric characteristics and the empty set for other characteristics.

2.3.1.g

Some passive abilities modify the characteristics of objects.

2.3.1.h

These abilities only affect objects in play.

2.3.1.i

Passive abilities apply continuously.

2.3.1.j

An object’s characteristics are its base characteristics, modified by
all applicable passive abilities.

2.3.1.k

What passive abilities do and what they apply to are re-evaluated
after each event.

2.3.1.l

When (re-)evaluating what passive abilities do, we consider that none
of them apply and (re-)apply them Passive abilities one at a time.
Remark.
Considering that passive abilities do not apply during reevaluation is limited to this process. Outside of the re-evaluation process,
only the final result, once all passive abilities have been re-evaluated in
order, should be considered.

35

Example.
Atlas
, which has the passive ability “Gigantic”, is
in the Hero Expedition of a player.
Amarok
, which has the reaction ability “When another Character joins my Expedition l Sacrifice it”
is in the Companion Expedition of that player. During the re-evaluation
of passive abilities, we consider for a moment that “Gigantic” does not
apply anymore. However, because at the end of the re-evaluation process
“Gigantic” applies again, Atlas has not left nor joined again the companion Expedition and must therefore not be sacrificed.

2.3.1.m

In order to determine the order in which passive abilities are applied,
Altered uses timestamps and dependency.

2.3.2

Dependency

2.3.2.a

Dependency is a relation between two passive abilities.

2.3.2.b

Dependency is defined through the notion of direct dependency.

2.3.2.c

A passive ability [A] directly depends on another passive ability [B]

if either:

2.3.2.d

Applying [B] would remove the existence of [A].

Example. Character [B] has ”all other characters loses their abilities”.
Character [A] has ”All regions are Forests”. Applying B removes [A]’s
ability. Therefore, [A] directly depends on [B].

2.3.2.e

Applying [B] changes what [A] applies to.

Example. Character A has ”All Elementals have Gigantic ”. Character
B has ”All Characters are Elementals”. Character C is not a Elemental.
Applying [B] makes [A] apply to [C]. Therefore [A] directly depends on [B]

36

2.3.2.f

Applying [B] changes what [A] does.

Example. Character [A] has ”If I am in Forest, I am Gigantic ” Character [B] has ”All regions are Forests ”. Therefore, [A] directly depends
on [B]

2.3.2.g

Dependency is the transitive closure of direct dependency:

• if [A] depends directly on [B], then [A] depends on [B];
• if [A] depends on [B] and [B] depends on [C], then [A] depends on [C].

2.3.3

Order of Application

2.3.3.a

An ability [A] is free from dependency if either:

• there is no unapplied ability [B] such that [A] depends on [B]; or
• for each unapplied ability [B], if [A] depends on [B], then [B] depends on
[A].

2.3.3.b

The next ability that is applied is the one with the smallest timestamp that is free from dependency.

2.3.3.c

Once an altering ability has been applied, dependencies are reevaluated to determine the next ability to apply.

2.4

Statuses

2.4.1

General

2.4.1.a

A status is one of the following: Anchored, Asleep, Boosted, exhausted, Fleeting.

2.4.1.b

Objects in Adventure, Expedition zone, Hero zone, Landmark zone,
Limbo, Mana zone, and Reserve may have one or several statuses.

37

2.4.1.c

Objects in Discard pile and cards in Deck or Hand cannot have or

gain statuses.

2.4.1.d

An object entering a new zone has no status until specified otherwise.

2.4.1.e

An object’s statuses do not change unless an effect causes them to

change.

2.4.1.f

An object that already has a status cannot gain that status.

2.4.1.g

Some objects have passive abilities that states that they can gain a
status that it already has. This is an exception to Rule 2.4.1.f. If an effect grants a
status to an object that already has that status, nothing happens, but that effect
can be modified and it can trigger Reactions.
Remark. Ninette has
Arcolano Milk
(“When a Character joins
my Expeditionl It gains 1 boost and Fleeting”) and
Technical Boots
(“When my Expedition moves forward l Target Character in my Expedition
loses Fleeting”) in her Hero Expedition and she plays
Gericht, Revered
Duelist
from her Reserve in her Hero Expedition. Gericht’s Reaction
activates twice: one from it entering Fleeting, and once from Arcolano
Milk’s Reaction giving it Fleeting again. If Gericht’s Expedition progresses
and Ninette uses the Reaction from Technical Boots to have Gericht lose
Fleeting, Gericht does not keep an “instance” of Fleeting: it will go to
Reserve during Rest.

2.4.1.h
2.4.2

An object that does not have a status cannot lose that status.

Anchored

• During Rest, an Anchored Character is not sent to Reserve.
• During Rest, an Anchored object loses Anchored.

38

2.4.3

Asleep

• During Progress, an Asleep Character’s statistics are not counted in their
expedition’s statistics.
• During Rest, an Asleep Character is not sent to Reserve.
• During Rest, an Asleep object loses Asleep.

Remark. If a Character is both Anchored and Asleep at Rest, it loses
both statuses.

2.4.4
2.4.4.a

Boosted
An object is Boosted if it has at least one boost on it.

2.4.4.b

Objects never directly gain or lose Boosted. This status changes
when boosts are added or removed from an object.
Remark. Characters keep their boost when they change zones, except
when they leave the Expedition or join the Discard pile, so if a player plays
a Boosted Character card from their Reserve, that Character enters the
Expedition zone Boosted.

2.4.5
2.4.5.a

Exhausted
Some costs and effects make an object exhausted.

Remark. The symbol T in the cost of an quick action means “exhaust
me” (see Rule 7.1.4.a). That cost cannot be paid if the object bearing that
quick action is already exhausted.

2.4.5.b

An object that is not exhausted is ready.

39

2.4.5.c

Exhausted cards in Reserve cannot be played.

2.4.5.d

Some passive abilities state that a player may play Exhausted cards
in Reserve. This passive ability is an exception to rule 2.4.5.c. It does not circumvent other restrictions.

2.4.5.e
2.4.6

Exhausted cards in Reserve have no support abilities.

Fleeting

2.4.6.a

When a card is played from Reserve, it gains Fleeting as it enters

Limbo.

2.4.6.b

Some spells have Fleeting as a passive ability. When such a spell is
played from anywhere, it gains the status Fleeting as it enters Limbo.

Remark.
zone.

Landmark Permanents cannot have or gain Fleeting in any

2.4.6.c

When a Fleeting Character or Expedition Permanent in Limbo resolves, it gains Fleeting as it enters the Expedition zone.

2.4.6.d

If a Fleeting Character or Expedition Permanent would go to the
Reserve from the Expedition zone, it is discarded instead.

2.4.6.e

When a Fleeting Spell in Limbo is done resolving, it is discarded
instead of going to Reserve.

2.5

Counters

2.5.a

Objects in Adventure, Expedition zone, Hero zone, Landmark zone,
Limbo, Mana zone, and Reserve may have counters on them.

2.5.b

Objects in Discard pile and cards in Deck or Hand cannot have or gain

counters.

40

2.5.c

Counters have names.

2.5.d

Counters with the same name on the same object are indistinguishable.

2.5.e

Some Heroes start the game with counters. Such counters are on the
Hero from the moment it is revealed and placed in the Hero zone.

2.5.f

Some steps have an object “gain [X] [name] counters”. After the resolution of such a step, that object has [X] more [name] counters than before.

2.5.g

Some steps “remove [X] [name] counters” from an object. After the
resolution of such a step, if that object had [X] or less [name] counters, it has now
zero [name] counters; if it had more than [X] [name] counters, that object has now
[X] less [name] counters than before.

2.5.h

Some objects have quick actions whose costs include “spending [X] of
their [name] counters”. In order to pay such costs, the object in question must
have at least [X] [name] counters. Once the cost is paid, it has [X] less [name]
counters.

2.5.i

Most counters have no intrinsic impact on the game.

2.5.j

When an object moves from the Expedition zone or the Landmark zone
to another zone, it loses all its counters.

2.5.k

When an object moves from the Reserve or the Limbo to another
visible zone, it keeps its counters (except if it goes to the Discard pile, in which
case it loses all its counters).

2.5.1

Boost Counters

2.5.1.a

Boost counters, also called +1/+1/+1 counters are a specific type

of counters.

2.5.1.b

If a Character has boost counters, each of them adds 1 to each of

its statistics.

41

3

Zones

3.1

Zone Properties

3.1.1

General

3.1.1.a

A zone is a set of objects or cards.

3.1.1.b

Zones always exist, even if they are empty.

3.1.1.c

There are ten kind of zones: Adventure, Deck, Discard pile, Expedition zone, Hand, Hero zone, Landmark zone, Limbo, Mana zone, and Reserve.
Remark. At the beginning of the game, all zones are empty, except from
the Adventure, the Hero zones, and the Decks.

3.1.2

Shared or Personal

3.1.2.a

Some zones are shared: there is only one instance of each shared
zone in the game.
Remark. Expedition zone, Adventure and Limbo are shared zones.

3.1.2.b

Some zones are personal: each player has one instance of each per-

sonal zone.
Remark. Deck, Hand, Hero zone, Landmark zone, Mana zone, Reserve
and Discard pile are personal zones.

3.1.2.c

If a card or an object would go to a personal zone that does not
belong to its owner, it goes to the corresponding zone of its owner instead.

42

3.1.3

Visible or Hidden

3.1.3.a

Some zones are visible: they contain objects.

Remark. Adventure, Discard pile, Expedition zone, Hero zone, Landmark zone, Limbo, Mana zone and Reserve are visible zones.

3.1.3.b

All players know the number and characteristics of objects in all

visible zones.

3.1.3.c

Some objects in visible zones are represented by face-down cards.
These objects have no base characteristics, except for those in the Mana zone
which are of type Mana Orb.

3.1.3.d

Some zones are hidden: they contain cards.

Remark. Deck and Hand are hidden zones.

3.1.3.e

All players know the number of cards in all hidden zones.

3.1.3.f

Players cannot look at cards in hidden zones unless a rule, effect, or
passive ability allows them to do so.
Remark. Costs and effects that use the characteristics of a card in a
hidden zone reveal that card beforehand.

3.1.4
3.1.4.a

In Play
An object is “in play” if it is in the Expedition zone or the Landmark

zone.

43

3.2

Zone-specific Rules

3.2.1

Adventure

3.2.1.a

The Adventure is a shared, visible zone.

Remark. The Adventure is a visible zone which contains face-down cards.
Players may not look at the face of face-down cards in the Adventure.

3.2.1.b

During regular play, the Adventure contains eight regions in a row:
the Hero region on one side, six regions represented by three Tumult cards, and
the Companion region on the other side.

3.2.1.c

During tiebreakers, all regions are replaced by a single region called

the Arena.
Remark.
At the beginning of the game, the three Tumult cards are
face-down. The six objects they represent have the type Region due to
Rule 2.2.1.e and no other characteristics.

3.2.2
3.2.2.a

Deck
The Deck is a personal hidden zone.

3.2.2.b

The cards in the Deck are ordered in a pile: the first card is called
the top card, the last card is called the bottom card, and other cards are designated
by their position relative to one of these cards.

3.2.2.c

If a step affects a card or a set of cards in a Deck, it specifies the
position of the affected card(s), relative to the top or the bottom of the Deck.

3.2.2.d

If an atomic action would affect a card at a specific position and the
Deck does not contain enough cards for that position to exist, shuffle cards in the
Discard pile and put them at the bottom of the Deck as part of the step containing
that atomic action. This is an additive event-modifying rule.

44

3.2.2.e

If that position still does not exist after shuffling the Discard pile at
the bottom of the Deck, any atomic action affecting that position does nothing.

3.2.2.f

If a step moves a card or a set of cards at a specific position and the
Deck does not contain enough cards, that card or set of cards is moved to the top
or to the bottom, respectively, if they were sent “X cards from the bottom” or “X
cards from the top”.

3.2.3

Discard Pile

3.2.3.a
3.2.4

The Discard pile is a personal, visible zone.

Expedition Zone

3.2.4.a

The Expedition zone is a shared, visible zone.

3.2.4.b

The Expedition zone is divided into sub-zones called Expeditions:
each player has a Hero Expedition and a Companion Expedition.

3.2.4.c

Expeditions always exist, even if they are empty.

3.2.4.d

An object that moves from one Expedition to another does not

change zones.

3.2.4.e

Each player knows in which Expedition every object in the Expedition zone is at all time.

3.2.5

Hand

3.2.5.a

The Hand is a personal, hidden zone.

3.2.5.b

Each player can look at and reorder their own Hand at any time.

3.2.5.c

If an effect or a cost acts on a card in a Hand, it either chooses a
card at random or it reveals that Hand to the player who chooses which card is
affected.

45

3.2.6

Hero Zone

3.2.6.a

The Hero zone is a personal, visible zone.

3.2.6.b

Each Hero zone contain up to one Hero.

3.2.7
3.2.7.a

Landmark Zone
The Landmark zone is a personal, visible zone.

3.2.7.b

The landmark limit of a player is the landmark limit of their Hero.
If they have no Hero (which may happen in limited formats), their landmark limit
is 2.
Remark. Players may have more objects in their Landmark zone than
their landmark limit. They only need to sacrifice excess objects during the
Night phase.

3.2.8
3.2.8.a

Limbo
Limbo is a shared, visible zone.

Remark. Limbo is usually not represented as a specific physical space in
a game: it is a transitory zone, which only contains cards when they are
played and short-lived Emblems.

3.2.9
3.2.9.a

Mana Zone
The Mana zone is a personal, visible zone.

Remark. The Mana zone is a visible zone which contains face-down
cards. Players may not look at the face of face-down cards in other players’
Mana zone.

46

3.2.9.b

When a player puts a card in the Mana zone, it enters the Mana
zone face-down and exhausted unless specified otherwise.
Remark. If that card was in a hidden zone prior to the move, that card
is not revealed as it changes zones.

3.2.9.c

Objects in the Mana zone have the type Mana Orb.

3.2.9.d

Players can look at the cards in their Mana zone at any time.

3.2.9.e

Players can exhaust a Mana Orb to ready another exhausted Mana
Orb in their Mana zone before any step that ask them to choose one of their Mana
Orbs.

3.2.9.f
3.2.10
3.2.10.a

A mana cost X can be paid by exhausting [X] Mana Orbs.

Reserve
The Reserve is a personal, visible zone.

phase.

47

4

Game Progression

4.1

Beginning of the Game

4.1.a

As the game starts, all zones are empty.

4.1.b

Place the two Adventure cards representing the Hero region and the
Companion region on either end of the Adventure.

4.1.c

Shuffle three different Tumult cards (position and orientation) and
place them face-down in the Adventure, between the Hero region and the Companion region.

4.1.d

Each player put their hero Expedition counter in the Hero region and
their companion Expedition counter in the Companion region.

4.1.e

Each player presents their deck and their Hero, face-down.

4.1.f

If a player has no Hero, they may present a face-down card from outside
the game (not from their deck) to disguise this fact until 4.1.h .

4.1.g

Determine the first player at random.

4.1.h

Each player reveals their Hero and place it in their Hero zone. If a
player had a non-Hero card face-down, it is removed from the game.

4.1.i

Each player shuffles their deck and puts it in their Deck zone.

4.1.j

Each player draws six cards.

4.1.k

Each player puts three cards in their Mana zone as ready Mana Orbs.

4.1.l

Start the first day; the first Morning is skipped.

48

4.2
4.2.a

Day Structure
A day contains five phases: Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Dusk, and

Night.

4.2.b

At the beginning of each phase, an event activates “at [that phase]”
Reactions, then Reactions are checked.
Remark. Only Reactions that trigger “at [that phase]” should exist in
Limbo at that moment. Also, if a new Reaction ability appears after that
activation event (including while resolving the Reactions triggered by that
activation event), they are not triggered.

Example. Subhash & Marmo
has a “At Noon” Reaction ability that
allows their controller to put a card from their Hand in Reserve. If they
put
Dredger Drone
in Reserve, which has a “At Noon” support
Reaction ability that allows it to gain one or two boosts, this ability will
not trigger this day and Dredger Drone does not gain any boosts.

4.2.c

During Morning, Dusk, and Night, some daily effects resolve.

4.2.d

After each daily effect, Reactions are checked.

Remark. After a daily effect, Reactions that triggered during this effect
and Reactions that trigger “after [that daily effect]” exist in Limbo. They
can be played in any order, as described in Section 4.4.

4.2.e

Once there are no more Reactions in Limbo, the next daily effect is
resolved; if there are no more daily effects in this phase, the next phase starts.

4.2.f

During Afternoon, the players take turns in succession, until all players
have passed.

49

4.2.g
4.2.1

After each turn effect, Reactions are checked.

Morning

4.2.1.a
4.2.1.b

There are four daily effects during Morning.

Succeed The player to the left of the first player becomes the first

player.

4.2.1.c

Prepare Each player readies all the exhausted cards and objects in
their personal zones and in their Expeditions (Heroes, Characters, Permanents,
Mana Orbs and other objects).
4.2.1.d

Draw Each player draws two cards.

4.2.1.e

Expand Each player may put one card from their Hand face-down

and ready in their Mana zone.
Remark. The players choose whether to put one or not in turn order.

4.2.2

Noon

4.2.2.a

There are no daily effects during Noon.

Remark. Nothing happens during Noon unless an “At Noon l” reaction
is activated.

4.2.3

Afternoon

4.2.3.a

There are no daily effects during the Afternoon.

4.2.3.b

During Afternoon, players alternate taking turns until all players

have passed.

50

4.2.3.c

The first player takes the first turn.

4.2.3.d

When a player takes a turn, they choose one of the three following
turn effect: playing a card, playing a quick action, or passing.

4.2.3.e

After that turn effect and the resulting Reactions:

1. If the player played a quick action, the turn continues; the player must
choose a new turn effect (they may choose to play another quick action).
2. If the player played a card or passed, the turn ends:
• if at least one player has not yet passed: the next player in turn order
who has not yet passed starts a new turn;
• if all players have passed: Afternoon ends and Dusk starts.

Remark. A player may take several turns in a row, if all other players
have passed.

4.2.4
4.2.4.a
4.2.4.b

Dusk
There is one daily effect during Dusk.

Progress Determine the statistics of each Expedition by adding, for

each terrain, the statistics of each Character in that Expedition. If an Expedition
has a greater positive statistic in a terrain of its region than the corresponding
statistic of the Expedition facing it, it moves forward.

4.2.4.c

If an Expedition cannot move forward due to [terrain], [terrain] is
ignored when determining whether it moves forward.

4.2.4.d

If an Expedition can only move forward due to [terrain], the other
terrains are ignored when determining if it moves forward. Moreover, it cannot
move forward for other reasons than Progress.

4.2.4.e

A tie is not suﬀicient to move forward.

51

4.2.4.f

A statistic of 0 is not suﬀicient to move forward, even if the corresponding statistic of the Expedition facing it is negative.

4.2.4.g

An expedition moves forward only once, even if they win in more
than one statistic.

4.2.4.h

All successful expeditions move forward simultaneously.

4.2.4.i

An expedition “fails to move forward” if it does not move forward
during Progress, unless tiebreakers have started.
Remark.
An expedition never “fails to move forward” outside of
Progress. An expedition that moved forward during a day can still “fail to
move forward” if it does not move forward during Progress.

4.2.4.j

An expedition “moves forward due to [terrain]” if the four following
conditions are true during the Progress step:
• it moves forward;
• it was in a region with type [terrain];
• no effect prevented it from moving forward due to [terrain];
• it had a greater [terrain] statistic than the Expedition facing it.

Remark. An expedition may move forward due to more than one statistic
at the same time.

4.2.5
4.2.5.a

Night
There are three daily effects during Night.

52

4.2.5.b

Rest Characters in the Expedition zone and Gears that belonged in
an Expedition that moved forward this day are sent to Reserve.
Remark. A number of statuses (Asleep, Anchored, Fleeting) and abilities
(Eternal) modify the Rest effect.

4.2.5.c

Clean-up Each player chooses as many objects in their Reserve as

their Hero’s reserve limit and as many objects in their landmarks as their Hero’s
landmark limit. All non-selected objects in Reserve are discarded and all nonselected objects in landmarks are sacrificed, simultaneously.
Remark.
The first player must make their choice known before the
second player makes their selection, and so on, in initiative order (see
Rule 6.1.h).

4.2.5.d

Check Victory

Each player sums the distance of their Expeditions

to their starting positions.
• If all players have a sum of 6 or less (their Expeditions have neither met nor
crossed), nothing happens, and we move to playing the next day.
• If one player has a sum equal to 7 (their Expeditions are on the same region)
or more (their Expeditions have crossed), and that sum is (strictly) greater
than the sum of all other opponents, they win the game.
• Otherwise, multiple players are tied with the highest sum (with expeditions
that have all met or that have crossed by the same amount of regions). In
that case, tiebreakers start (see Section 4.3).

Remark.
A player may have excess objects in their Reserve and or
Landmark zone at the end of the day, if the Clean-up effect has been
modified, the limits have changed, or a Reaction triggered off Clean-up
and put some objects in one of these zones.

53

4.3

Tiebreakers

4.3.a

When tiebreakers start during Check Victory, turn the Companion
region card face-down and put all Expedition markers on it. Discard all other
regions.

4.3.b

The new region is called the Arena.

4.3.c

The Arena has the terrains V, M, and O.

4.3.d

Once tiebreakers have started, Expeditions cannot move forward or

backward.

4.3.e

The “Progress” daily effect of Dusk is modified as follows:

1. Determine the statistics of each Expeditions by adding, for each terrain, the
statistics of all Character in that Expedition.
2. Each player determines a single set of statistics by adding, for each terrain,
the statistics of all their Expeditions.
3. Compare each statistic individually.
4. If a player has more of the Arena’s terrains with a greater (positive) statistic
than their opponent, they win the game. Otherwise, the game continues.

4.3.f

The “Check Victory” daily effect of Night has no effect during tiebreak-

ers.
Remark. Tiebreakers may last for several days.

4.4

Checking Reactions

4.4.a

At several points during the day, players are instructed to “check

Reactions”:
1. at the beginning of each phase;
2. after each daily effect;

54

3. after each turn effect;
4. after a player plays a Reaction.

Remark.
Some effects allow players to play a card during their resolution. In these cases, Reactions are not checked until the end of the
resolution of the whole daily effect, turn effect, or Reaction.

4.4.b
When that happens, if there is an Emblem-Reaction in Limbo, the
first player in initiative order who controls a Reaction in Limbo chooses one of
them and plays it.
4.4.c

Once that Reaction has been played, Reactions are checked again.

Remark. If more than one player has Reactions to play in Limbo, the
player with initiative plays all their Reaction before the next players play
their own. If new Reactions are created during this process, they may be
chosen by their controller just like already existing Reactions.

4.4.d

Once there are no more playable Emblem-Reactions remaining in
Limbo, the game progresses to the next turn, daily effect, phase, or day.

55

Playing cards and objects

5.1

General

5.1.1

Timing

5.1.1.a

At certain times, players have the possibility to “play” a card, a
quick action, or a Reaction.

5.1.1.b

During their turn, a player may play a card or a quick action as a

turn effect.

5.1.1.c

Whenever Reactions are checked, the first player in initiative order
who owns a Reaction in Limbo must play a Reaction.

5.1.1.d
5.1.2

Some effects instruct a player to play a card.

Playing process

5.1.2.a

The process of playing a card has four parts: declare intent, move
to Limbo, pay costs, and resolution.

5.1.2.b

The process of playing a quick action or Reaction has three parts:
declare intent, pay costs, and resolution.

5.1.2.c

In the declaration of intent, a player must:

1. Reveal the card or the quick action being played, if it is currently in a hidden
zone;
2. Choose modes and alternative or optional costs;
3. Declare how costs will be paid.

5.1.2.d

Playing a card always has a mana cost. It is the Hand Cost when it
is played from the Hand and the Reserve Cost when it is played from the Reserve.

56

5.1.2.e

When a player plays a card and cost alterations apply, to determine
the final cost, the player must, in the following order:
1. Apply all cost increases in any order;
2. Apply all cost decreases in any order;
3. Apply all restrictions on the final cost, in order of timestamp.

This is an exception to Rule 2.3.3.b (about ordering passive abilities with timestamps).
Example. Marcus has
Robin Hood
in one of his Expeditions,
which has the passive ability “Cards your opponents play can’t cost less
than 2”. When his opponent plays a card, they apply all cost increases
first, in the order of their choice, then all cost decreases, in the order of
their choice. Finally, Robin Hood’s ability applies, and if the card would
cost less than 2, it costs 2 instead.

Remark. Some cards specify restrictions on an increase or decrease in
cost. These restrictions only apply to this specific increase or decrease and
are not restrictions on the final cost.
An example of such a card is
Ebenezer Scrooge
, which has the
ability: “Cards played from Reserve cost 1 less, down to a minimum of
1”.

Remark.
When playing a card for free, payment of costs is skipped,
regardless of the cost alterations.

5.1.2.f

The game state should not change during the declaration of intent.
Once all these decisions have been taken, check whether the declaration is legal.
If it is not, the player must take different decisions (including the decision to play
that particular card, quick action, or Reaction).

5.1.2.g

Once a player has declared how they intend to play a card, they
move it to Limbo unless it was already there.

57

5.1.2.h

In the payment of costs, all costs must be paid simultaneously, as
described in 6.4.

5.1.2.i

During resolution:

• a Character or an Expedition Permanent joins the Expedition that was
chosen when it was played;
• a Landmark Permanent card joins the Landmark zone;
• a Spell performs its effect, then joins the Reserve;
• a quick action performs its effect;
• a Reaction performs its effect, then ceases to exist.

5.1.2.j

Some Reactions’ triggers read “when a card is played”. These Reactions are activated by the step where the card leaves Limbo at the end of its
resolution:
• to the Expedition zone for Characters and Expedition Permanents;
• to the Landmark zone for Landmark Permanents;
• to the Reserve or the Discard pile for Spells.

5.2

Playing a Card

5.2.a

When a rule or effect allows a player to play a card, they may play a
card from their Hand or their Reserve unless specified otherwise.

5.2.b

When playing a card other than a Spell, if a passive ability (including an Emblem-Ongoing) states that the card being played should gain or lose
a counter (including boosts) or a status, an Emblem-Reaction with that effect is
created in Limbo during the resolution of that card.

58

Example. Nate uses the support ability of
Lady of the Lake
which
states “The next Character you play this turn loses Fleeting”. He then plays
Bravos Tracer
which has the Reaction “j I gain Fleeting”. When
he does, two Emblem-Reactions are created in Limbo: one to make Bravos
Tracer gain Fleeting, and one to make it lose Fleeting. Nate can resolve
them in the order of his choice, and therefore make it not have Fleeting.
This is also the case if it was played from Reserve.

5.2.1

Playing a Character

5.2.1.a

During the declaration of intent, the player must choose in which of
their Expedition they play their Character card.

5.2.1.b

When a Character card is moved to Limbo, if it was played from
Reserve, it gains Fleeting.

5.2.1.c

During the resolution of a Character card, that Character enters the
chosen Expedition. If it had Fleeting in Limbo, it gains Fleeting.

5.2.2

Playing an Expedition Permanent

5.2.2.a

During the declaration of intent, the player must choose in which of
their Expedition they play their Expedition Permanent card.

5.2.2.b

When an Expedition Permanent is moved to Limbo, if it was played
from Reserve, it gains Fleeting.

5.2.2.c

During the resolution of an Expedition Permanent card, that Permanent enters the chosen Expedition. If it had Fleeting in Limbo, it gains Fleeting.

5.2.3

Playing a Landmark Permanent

59

5.2.3.a

During the resolution of a Landmark Permanent card, that Permanent enters its controller’s Landmark zone.
Remark. Landmark Permanents cannot have the status Fleeting, even
if they were played from Reserve.

5.2.4

Playing a Spell Card

5.2.4.a

When a Spell card is moved to Limbo, in the following order:

1. If it was played from Reserve, it gains Fleeting.
2. If it has Fleeting as a passive ability in its text box, it gains Fleeting.
3. If a passive ability (including an Emblem-Ongoing) states that the Spell
card being played should gain or lose Fleeting, it gains or loses it.

5.2.4.b

When a non-Fleeting Spell’s resolution is done, that Spell moves to
Reserve; if that Spell had Cooldown, it becomes Exhausted. When a Fleeting
Spell’s resolution is done, that Spell moves to the Discard pile.

5.3

Playing a Quick Action

5.3.a

Playing a quick action follows the same process as playing a Spell, with
the following differences:

5.3.b

A player may only play a quick action of a Character or Permanent
they control, their Hero, or a support quick action of a card in their Reserve.

5.3.c

As quick actions are not objects, they do not change zones.

5.3.d

Some quick actions have the symbol T in their cost. That cost is paid
by exhausting the object bearing that quick action.

5.3.e
A given quick action may not be played more than a hundred times in
a single day.

60

5.4

Playing Reactions

5.4.a

Playing a Reaction follows the same process as playing a Spell, with
the following differences:

5.4.b

As Reactions are played from Limbo, they do not change zones.

5.4.c

Reactions do not have costs.

5.4.d

When a Reaction’s resolution is done, that Reaction ceases to exist.

61

6

From Costs and Effects to Events

6.1

General

6.1.a

Costs and effect are sequences of instructions that affect the game
state. Paying a cost or resolving an effect consist in following these instructions.

6.1.b

An effect may involve multiple steps.

6.1.c

There is a separate step for each verb in an effect description, unless
these verbs are said to happen “simultaneously”
Example.
Spy Craft
has the effect “Sabotage, then Resupply”.
The resolution of Spy Craft involves two steps. In the first step, the controller of Spy Craft performs Sabotage. In the second step, they perform
Resupply.

6.1.d

Costs always have a single step.

Example. Subhash & Marmo
have the Reaction “At Noon l You may
pay 1 and put a card from your Hand in Reserve to create a Brassbug
2/2/2 Robot token in target Expedition”. Paying 1 and putting a card
from Hand to Reserve happen in the same step.

6.1.e

A single step may involve multiple objects. In this case, there is a
separate atomic action for each affected object.
Example.
Open the Gates
has the effect “Create two Ordis
Recruit 1/1/1 Soldier tokens in each of your Expeditions”. There is only
one step in the resolution of Open the Gates. It has four atomic actions,
one for each token.

6.1.f

Atomic actions in a single step happen simultaneously.

62

6.1.g

Some steps require decisions. Unless specified otherwise, these decisions are made by the controller of the effect containing that step. They are made
immediately before the step would occur; they do not constitute a step in themselves. If one of the options is impossible, it cannot be chosen. If all the options
are impossible, the corresponding atomic actions do not happen.
Remark. A choice that would result in an effect having no consequence
on the game state is not considered impossible for this reason alone. For
Beauty Sleep
has the ability “Target Character gains
example,
Asleep”. Its controller may target a Character which is already Asleep,
even if it cannot gain Asleep again.

6.1.h

Some steps require decisions by more than one player. Such choices
are made in initiative order. If that choice involves an object from a visible zone,
other players know which object has been chosen. If the choice involves a card
from a hidden zone, they must make their choice explicit, but they do not need to
reveal the chosen card.
Example.
Ninette plays a game against Lithium. During her turn,
Ninette plays
Kitsune
from her Hand. Kitsune has the Reaction
“h Each player may Resupply”. She must let Lithium know whether or
not she chooses to Resupply before he takes his decision. However, if she
chooses to Resupply, Lithium will not see Ninette’s top card until after
he decides whether to Resupply or not.
In his turn, Lithium plays
Anubis
, which has the Reaction “j
Each player sacrifices a Character”. Lithium must choose which Character
to sacrifice before Ninette, and Ninette knows which Character he chose
to sacrifice when she makes her choice. Both Characters are sacrificed
simultaneously.

6.2

Modifiers

6.2.a

Some rules and passive abilities are modifiers, which change the way a
step affects the game state.

63

6.2.b

Some modifiers change what a step or an atomic action does. These
modifiers are called replacing modifiers; they are usually written with the word
“instead”.

6.2.c

Some modifiers add atomic actions to a step. These modifiers are called
additive modifiers; they are usually written with the word “also”.

6.2.d

Some replacing modifiers are optional; they are usually written with
the words “you may”. When this modifier is about to be applied, the controller
of object with the ability containing it must state whether or not it should be
applied.

6.2.e
Some optional replacing modifiers also state an alternative if the controller of the effect that contains them decides to not apply them. They are written
“If you don’t, [effect]”. When a player decides to not apply an optional replacing
modifier with an alternative, a new step to resolve [effect] of the alternative is
added to the effect currently being resolved, right after the current step and the
other steps that were added this way during the resolution of the current step.
Example.
Ninette plays a game against Lithium. During her turn,
Ninette plays
Paint Prison
from her Hand, targeting Lithium’s
Mighty Jinn
to return it to the top of Lithium’s Deck.
Mighty Jinn has the ability “If I would leave the Expedition zone, you may
put me in my owner’s Mana zone instead. If you don’t, draw a card.”.
Lithium decides to not put Mighty Jinn in his Mana zone, so a new step is
added after the resolution of the current (and only) step of Paint Prison.
Mighty Jinn is sent to the top of the Deck, then the added step is resolved,
making Lithium draw Mighty Jinn.

6.2.f

Modifiers may apply to steps, or atomic actions.

6.2.g

When a step is about to happen, check whether a modifier would apply
to that step or an atomic action in that step. If one does, the controller of that
step chooses one of them and applies it:
1. Replacing modifiers that apply to the whole step must be applied first;
2. Replacing modifiers that apply to an atomic action must be applied next;

64

3. Additive modifiers must be applied last.

6.2.h

If there are multiple applicable modifiers, the controller of the step, or
the first player in initiative order if that step has no controller, chooses which one
is applied first.

6.2.i

Once a modifier has been applied, check whether another modifier
applies to the modified step.

6.2.j

Once a modifier has been applied to a whole step, it cannot apply again
to that step.

6.2.k

Once a modifier applies to an atomic action, it cannot apply again to
that atomic action.

6.2.l

Modifiers have to exist before the step they try to modify, unless they
are a passive ability of an object which modifies specifically how that object enters
a zone.

6.2.m

Once no more modifiers apply to a step, it happens and becomes an
event. Reactions are then tested for activation by this event (see Rule 6.3.g).

6.3
6.3.a

Reactions
Some abilities are Reactions. They are written “Trigger l Effect”.

6.3.b

A trigger specifies what must happen in an event to activate its Reaction. It may also specify an additional condition for the Reaction to be activated.
This condition is written after a comma.

6.3.c

Reactions whose trigger mentions the pronoun “I” entering a visible
zone (including by “being played”, entering a subset of the Expedition zone or
moving to a visible zone) are called self-move Reactions.
Remark. j, h and r abilities are self-move Reactions.

65

6.3.d

A self-move Reaction is activated by an event if:

• it exists in the game state after the event;
• its trigger matches the event.

Example. Régis plays
Mind Apotheosis
and puts
Asmodeus
in play while resolving Mind Apotheosis’ effect. Because it is a selfmove Reaction, the j Reaction of Asmodeus is activated, even though it
did not exist before the event that triggered it.

Remark.
Contrary to other Reactions (see Rule 6.3.e ), self-move
Reactions do not need to “work” (be in play) in order to be activated, only
The Machine in the
their condition is taken into account. For example,
Ice
has the following Reaction: “When I go to Reserve from anywhere
l Exhaust me (T)”. This reaction is activated when The Machine in the
Ice arrives in Reserve from any other zone, even if it is not in play.

6.3.e

A Reaction other than a self-move Reaction is activated by an event

if:
• it exists and works in the game state before the event;
• its trigger matches the event.

Example. Bob plays
Mana Reaping
on Alice’s
Armored
Jammer
. Armored Jammer has the following Reaction: “When I leave
your Landmark zone l Sabotage”. As Mana Reaping resolves, because
Armored Jammer’s Reaction is not a self-move Reaction, it is activated,
even though it does not exist anymore after the event.

6.3.f

A Reaction may be activated multiple times by a single event if its
trigger matches distinct atomic actions of that event.

66

6.3.g

After a regular step happens and becomes an event, a single Reactionactivating step is performed. This step contains, for each time a Reaction is
activated by that regular step, an atomic action which creates an Emblem-Reaction
in Limbo with the effect of that Reaction.

6.3.h

The effect of a Reaction might reference objects determined by the
trigger. In that case, the effect of the Emblem-Reaction is bound to these objects.
Example. Léa has
The Monolith, Ordis Bastion
in her Landmark
zone, which has the Reaction “When a Character joins your Expeditions l
It gains 1 boost”. On her turn, she plays
Open the Gates
which
creates two Character tokens in each of her Expeditions. The Reaction
of The Monolith, Ordis Bastion is activated four times, one for each new
Character token, creating each time an Emblem-Reaction in Limbo with
the word “it” of the Reaction’s effect bound to a distinct Character token.

6.3.i

If the effect of a Reaction refers to the pronoun “I”, it is bound to the
object from which that Reaction originates.

6.3.j

An effect of a Reaction might be bound to an object that does not exist
anymore (usually because it has been moved to another zone). Even though such
an object cannot be altered (for example, it cannot gain a status or be moved), it
is possible to use its characteristics and location to resolve an effect: they are the
characteristics and location it had when it stopped existing.
Example. If a Character has a Reaction “When I go to Reserve from
the Expedition zone l Create an Ordis Recruit 1/1/1 Soldier token in my
Expedition”, “my” is a reference to the object of the Expedition zone that
was moved to Reserve. Therefore, the token is created in the Expedition it
was in before being moved.

6.3.k

If a trigger specifies an additional condition, that condition can reference the game state before the event is applied (using the past tense) or the game
state after the event is applied (using the present tense).

67

Example.
Haven Seiringar
has the following Reaction: “When
I leave the Expedition zone, if I was Fleeting l Draw a card”. When this
card leaves the Expedition zone, the condition checks if Haven Seiringar
was fleeting before it left the Expedition zone, as the past tense is used in
the trigger.

6.3.l

A given Reaction cannot be activated more than 100 times in a single
day. If a Reaction would be activated a 101st time, it is not activated and no
atomic action is created for that Reaction during the Reaction-activating step.

6.4

Costs

6.4.a

Costs always have a single step, even if their description involves mul-

tiple verbs.

6.4.b

A player may always decline to pay a cost.

6.4.c

If a player chooses to pay a cost, they must be able to pay it in full.

6.4.d

If a player declines to pay the cost of a card, they may not play that
card. The game goes back to the point where the player was offered the possibility
of playing that card.

6.4.e

If a player declines to pay the cost of a quick action, they may not play
that quick action. The game goes back to the point where the player was offered
the possibility of playing that quick action.

6.5
6.5.a

Effects
Effects are usually mandatory.

6.5.b

Some effects have steps which require targets. Before resolving such a
step, the controller of the effect must choose a suitable object, Expedition, zone,
or player for each target in the step. Each object, Expedition, zone, or player may
only be chosen once per step as a target. If a subsequent step requires a target,

68

it can be chosen again as a target. If there are no suitable targets, any associated
atomic action does nothing.

6.5.c

Some effects have optional steps. They are written “You may [do step]”.
The controller of the effect chooses whether to do [step] or not just before that step
would happen. If they choose not to, the step is ignored and the effect continues
resolving.

6.5.d

Some effects have conditional steps. They are written “If [condition],
[do step]” or “[Do step] unless [condition]”. The condition is evaluated just before
that step would happen. If it is false in the first case, or true in the second, the
step is ignored and the effect continues resolving.

6.5.e

Some effect have two successive conditional steps written “If [condition], [do step one]. Otherwise [do step two]”. While resolving such an effect,
the condition is only evaluated once, after which either [step one] or [step two] is
performed. In particular, if [step one] changes the condition from true to false,
[step two] is not performed.

6.5.f

Some conditional effects are written “[Do X]; if you did, [do Y]” or
“[You may do X]; if you did, [do Y]”. The condition is true if the player started do
[do X], even if that event was modified.

6.5.g

Some effects are modal: they contain a step that says “Choose [a
number X]”, followed by a series of lines starting with •, called modes. When
resolving the choosing step, the controller of the effect must choose X modes in
the order of their choice. The chosen modes are then resolved in that order. The
non-chosen modes are ignored. Each mode may be chosen at most once, unless
the effect specifies that the same mode may be chosen more than once.

6.5.h

If part of an effect cannot be performed, it is ignored; the remainder
of the effect happens as normal.
Example.
Anubis
has the Reaction “j Each player sacrifices a
Character”. If a player controls no Character and thus cannot sacrifice a
Character, the other players still have to sacrifice a Character.

69

6.5.i

Some effects have steps that happen multiple times. They are written
“[Do step] [X] times”, or “[Do step] for each [quantity]”. Such steps are performed
X times, one after the other. In particular, if performing one of these steps involves
a choice, that choice can be different in two successive instances of that step.
Example. Lithium plays
The Snow Maiden
, whose h ability is
“Target opponent may Exhausted Resupply twice”, and chooses Ninette
as target opponent when he resolves its h ability. Ninette can perform
Exhausted Resupply once, twice, or not at all, and she can choose whether
to do it a second time after she resolved it a first time. In a multiplayer
game, Lithium could choose two different target opponents.

7.3.1

Activates

7.3.1.a

An “event activates [a reaction]” if this event matches that Reaction’s
trigger (resulting in the creation of an Emblem - Reaction with that Reaction’s
effect). A Reaction must exist to be activated (either before or after the event,
depending on the kind of Reaction, see Rules 6.3.d and 6.3.e).

73

7.3.1.b

Some steps say “Activate [a reaction]”. When that step occurs, the
resulting event activates the Reaction, even though it does not (usually) match
the trigger of that Reaction. This is an exception to Rules 6.3.d and 6.3.e.

7.3.1.c

Some earlier printings have effects that say “Activate [a trigger]”
instead of “Activate [a reaction]”. This means “activate a Reaction with [that
trigger].

7.3.1.d

If an ability of an object activates a Reaction of another object, the
Reaction is created by the second object, not the first.
Example. Brassbug Hub has the Reaction “j I gain three Kelon counters” and Dr. Frankenstein has the Reaction “r You may activate the j
abilities of target Permanent you control”. If Brassbug Hub is chosen as
the target Dr. Frankenstein’s Reaction, Brassbug Hub gains three Kelon
counters, not Dr. Frankenstein.

7.3.1.e

Some abilities say that [a trigger] “cannot activate”. Reactions containing this trigger cannot activate, either naturally or through another effect that
would activate them.
Example. The Council has the ability “The j, h, and r triggers of
Characters facing me don’t activate and Hua Mulan has the ability “r
I lose Fleeting.”. If Hua Mulan is played from Reserve in the Expedition
facing The Council, it does not lose Fleeting.

7.3.2
7.3.2.a

After You
“After you” means “End the turn once there are no Reactions in

Limbo”.

7.3.2.b

“After you” is not passing.

74

Example.
Alice
has the support ability “D: After You”. If a
player plays this action, the next player in initiative order gets the initiative
as soon as there are no Reactions in Limbo. Alice’s owner has not passed,
and they will be able to play actions and cards in this Afternoon.

7.3.3

Augment

7.3.3.a

To “augment” a card or an object means having it gain one more of
a (single) counter it already has.
Remark. Boosts are also counters.

7.3.4
7.3.4.a

Create
To create a token is to put a new Character token in the Expedition

zone.

7.3.4.b

Costs and effects that create tokens use the following template: “create a [name] [x/y/z] [sub-types] token with [abilities] in [expedition]”.
Example. Open the Gates (common) has the ability “Create two Ordis
Recruit 1/1/1 Soldier tokens in each of your Expeditions”. When Open
the Games resolves, four tokens are created. They all have the name “Ordis
Recruit”, the type “Character”, the sub-type “Soldier”, all three statistics
equal to 1, and no abilities.

7.3.5

Discard

7.3.5.a

To “discard” an [object or card] is to move this object or that card
from its current zone to the Discard pile.

7.3.6

Double (counters)
75

7.3.6.a

To “double the [name] counters” of an object means having that
object gain the same number of that counter it already had.

7.3.6.b
7.3.7

It is impossible to double 0 counters.

Draw

7.3.7.a

To “draw X cards” is to move the top X cards of one’s Deck to their

Hand.

7.3.7.b
7.3.8

“Draw a card” means “draw 1 card”.

Exchange (boosts)

7.3.8.a

To “exchange the boosts” of two characters means having each of
them simultaneously gain or lose the difference in their number of boosts (the one
with the most boosts loses it, the one with the least boosts gains it).

7.3.8.b

If the two characters have the same number of boosts, nothing hap-

pens.

7.3.9

Exchange (objects or cards)

7.3.9.a

To exchange two objects or cards is to move each of them to the

other’s zone.

7.3.9.b

If one or both of the objects cannot be determined, the exchange
cannot happen.
Example. Lithium plays
Sleight of Hand
, whose effect reads
“Exchange target card in your Reserve with a card from your Hand”. If
Lithium’s Hand and/or Reserve is empty, nothing happens as Sleight of
Hand resolves.

7.3.10

Exhaust
76

7.3.10.a

To “exhaust” an object means have it gain the status exhausted.

7.3.10.b

The symbol T in the cost of a quick action means “exhaust me”.

7.3.11

Exhausted Resupply

7.3.11.a

When a player performs “Exhausted Resupply”, they Resupply,
then they exhaust the resupplied card.
Remark.
If a modifier affects Resupply, it also affects Exhausted
Resupply. Likewise, if a Reaction triggers off Resupply, it also triggers
off Exhausted Resupply; however, such a Reaction cannot be played before
the resupplied card is exhausted.

7.3.12

Gain (counters)

7.3.12.a

When an object “gains X [name] counters”, X [name] counters are
put on that object.

7.3.12.b

Counters with the same name on the same object are fungible:
they do not need to be distinguished from one another.

7.3.13
7.3.13.a

Gain (status)
When an object “gains a status”, it has that status from that point

onwards.

7.3.13.b

An object with a given status cannot gain that status again. In
particular, it is impossible to exhaust an exhausted object.

7.3.14

Ignore

7.3.14.a

Some passive abilities state that some abilities should be ignored
during a given period.

77

7.3.14.b

During that period, these abilities exist, but they have no effect:
passive abilities do not modify events, quick actions may not be played, and Reactions do not activate.
Remark. An ability that would ignore itself works normally.

7.3.15

Lose (status)

7.3.15.a

When an object “loses a status”, it ceases to have that status from
that point onward.

7.3.15.b
7.3.16

An object without a given status cannot lose that status.

Move Backward

7.3.16.a

To move [an expedition] backward means “to move the corresponding counter from its current region to the next region in the direction whence it
came (toward the Hero region for the hero Expedition and towards the Companion
region for the the companion Expedition)”.

7.3.16.b

If an Expedition in its region of origin would move backwards,
nothing happens.

7.3.16.c

If an Expedition in the Arena would move backward, nothing hap-

pens.

7.3.17

Move Forward

7.3.17.a

To move [an expedition] forward means “to move the corresponding
counter from its current region to the next region in the direction it is going
(towards the Companion region for the hero Expedition and towards the Hero
region for the the companion Expedition).

7.3.17.b
If an Expedition would move into a region represented by half a
face-down Tumult card, instead this Tumult card is revealed and the Expedition
moves into it.
78

7.3.17.c

If an Expedition in the region opposite to its region of origin would
move forward, nothing happens.

7.3.17.d

If an Expedition in the Arena would move forward, nothing hap-

pens.

7.3.18

Ready

7.3.18.a

To ready [an object] means that [that object] loses the status Ex-

hausted.

7.3.18.b
7.3.19

An object that is not exhausted cannot be readied.

Roll a Die

7.3.19.a

To “roll a die” is to roll a fair six-sided die and to note the result.

7.3.19.b

Effects that have “roll a die” as one of their steps have a subsequent
step that uses the result of that roll.

7.3.19.c

Some passive abilities allow a player to roll multiple dice and choose
one of them or give them the option to modify a roll. A player who benefits from
one of these abilities may look at the result of the rolled dice before deciding which
die and which modifiers to use.

7.3.20

Play For Free

7.3.20.a

To “play a card or quick action for free” means to play that card
or quick action while skipping:
• the declaration of how costs will be paid during the declaration of intent
(Rule 5.1.2.c);
• the payment of costs (Rules 5.1.2.a and 5.1.2.b).

7.3.21

Put

79

7.3.21.a

To put [an object] or [a card] in [a zone] means “to move [that
object or that card] to [that zone]”.

7.3.21.b
7.3.22

“Put”, “return”, and “send” are synonyms rules-wise.

Resupply

7.3.22.a

To “resupply” is to put the top card of one’s Deck into one’s Re-

serve.

7.3.22.b

If a player with an empty Deck would resupply, they shuffle their
Discard pile into their Deck before putting the top card into the Reserve. If the
Deck is still empty at that point, Resupply does nothing.

7.3.23

Return

7.3.23.a

To return [an object] to [a zone] means “to move [that object] to

[that zone]”.

7.3.23.b

It does not matter whether the object ever was on that zone earlier.

7.3.23.c

“Put”, “return”, and “send” are synonyms rules-wise.

7.3.24
7.3.24.a

Sabotage
To “sabotage” means to discard up to one target card in a Reserve.

Remark. A player may Sabotage a card from their own Reserve.

7.3.25

Sacrifice

7.3.25.a

When a player has to “sacrifice” [an object], they have to discard
an object in play they control.

80

7.3.25.b

Even if the discard atomic action is modified, it is still considered

a sacrifice.
Remark.
In particular, when sacrificing a token, the discard atomic
action is modified by Rule 2.1.e but it is still considered a sacrifice.

7.3.26

Send

7.3.26.a

To send [an object] to [a zone] means “to move [that object] to

[that zone]”.

7.3.26.b
7.3.27

“Put”, “return”, and “send” are synonyms rules-wise.

Spend (counters)

7.3.27.a

When an object “spends X of its [name] counters”, X [name] counters that were on that object are removed from it.

7.3.27.b

An object cannot spend more counters with a given name that it

has on it.

7.3.28

Switch Expeditions

7.3.28.a

To “switch expeditions” means to send an object from one Expedition to the other of the same player.

7.3.28.b

A Character that switches Expeditions leaves its former Expedition
and joins its new Expedition. It neither leaves nor joins the Expedition zone.

7.4

Keyword Abilities

7.4.1

Cooldown

7.4.1.a

Cooldown is a passive ability that appears on Spells.

81

7.4.1.b
A Spell with Cooldown that goes to the Reserve after its resolution
becomes exhausted.
7.4.1.c

In itself, Cooldown does nothing. Instead, Rule 5.2.4.b has an extra
step for Spells with Cooldown.

7.4.2
7.4.2.a

Defender
Defender is a passive ability that appears on Characters.

7.4.2.b

An expedition containing a Character with Defender cannot move
forward during Dusk.

7.4.2.c

Defender applies to any reason why an Expedition might move forward during Dusk, not just the Progress daily effect.

7.4.3

Eternal

7.4.3.a

Eternal is a passive ability that appears on Characters.

7.4.3.b

An Eternal Character is not sent to the Reserve during Rest.

7.4.4

Gigantic

7.4.4.a

Gigantic is a passive ability that appears on Characters.

7.4.4.b

A Gigantic object is present in both Expeditions of its controller.

7.4.4.c

When a player plays a card with Gigantic or creates a token with
Gigantic, they play it or create it in a specific Expedition. They do not put two
cards or two tokens in play. The card is played or the token created in a single
Expedition but joins both Expeditions.

7.4.4.d

When a Gigantic object enters the Expedition zone, its j, h, and
r trigger only once.

82

7.4.4.e
A Gigantic Character’s statistics are counted in each of its controller’s Expeditions.
7.4.4.f
If an effect refers to a Gigantic Character’s Expedition, it refers to
both of its controller’s Expeditions.
Remark. On a Character that is Gigantic because of an effect, “my
Expedition” can be understood as “your Expeditions”.

7.4.4.g

If an effect refers to the Expedition facing a Gigantic Character, it
refers to the Expeditions facing each of its controller’s Expeditions.
Remark. On a Character that is Gigantic because of an effect, “the
Expedition facing me” can always be understood as “the Expeditions facing
me”. In a 2-player game only, it can be understood as “your opponent’s
Expeditions”.

7.4.4.h

If an effect originally refers to a single Expedition when stating where
a Character should be played, a token should be created or an object or card should
be moved, but refers to multiple Expeditions due to a Gigantic Character, these
Expeditions are not considered separately but as a single subset of the Expedition
zone. Therefore, for each object or card, the player performing the action must
pick an Expedition where to place it.
Example.
During limited play, Anna only has one card in her Hero
Expedition:
Eat Me Energy Bars
, which has the ability “If there
is only one Character in my Expedition, it is Gigantic”. She then plays
Ratatoskr
from Reserve, which has the ability “r Create two
Ordis Recruit 1/1/1 Soldier tokens in my Expedition”, also in her Hero
Expedition. Resolving the effect of Ratatoskr, which is Gigantic because
of Eat Me Energy Bars, she creates two Character tokens. She may create
them both in her Hero Expedition, both in her Companion Expedition, or
one in each of them.

83

7.4.4.i
If a trigger originally refers to a single Expedition that a card must
join or leave, but refers to multiple Expeditions due to a Gigantic Character, these
Expeditions are not considered separately but as a single subset of the Expedition
zone.
Example. A player has
Amarok
which has the ability “When
another Character joins my Expedition l Sacrifice it” in their Hero Expedition. They also have
Eat Me Energy Bars
, in their Hero Expedition, making Amarok Gigantic. If a Character is moved from their
Companion Expedition to their Hero Expedition, it does not get sacrificed.
This is not because Amarok loses Gigantic, as the Reaction ability only
needs to exist before the event (see Rule 6.3.e), but because the Character
did not join the subset of the Expedition zone consisting of “Amarok’s Expeditions”, as it was already in it.

7.4.4.j

If an effect or a trigger originally refers to a single Expedition when
stating a condition that must be met by this Expedition for something to happen
but refers to multiple Expeditions due to a Gigantic Character, these Expeditions
must all satisfy that condition, and the effect is resolved only once.
Example. If
Ordis Overseer
is Gigantic when resolving her
ability “j If my Expedition is behind, create an Ordis Recruit 1/1/1
Soldier token in my Expedition.”, both Expeditions must be behind and
only one token is created.

7.4.4.k

If an effect refers to the other Expedition of a Gigantic Character’s
controller, or the Expedition facing it, this effect refers to no Expeditions. If a
step of such an effect would move a card or an object to or create a token in that
Expedition, it is impossible and therefore does not happen.

7.4.4.l

During tiebreakers, a Gigantic Character’s statistics are counted
twice for their controller’s total statistics.

7.4.4.m

If a Gigantic Character would switch Expeditions, the card representing it switches Expeditions. As long as it remains Gigantic, the Character
itself does not leave nor join either Expedition.

84

7.4.4.n

If a non-Gigantic Character would gain Gigantic, it remains in the
Expedition containing the card that represents it and joins the other Expedition
of its controller.

7.4.4.o

If a Gigantic Character would lose Gigantic, it remains in the Expedition that contains the card that represents it and leaves the other Expedition
of its controller.

7.4.5
7.4.5.a

Scout X
Scout is a passive ability that appears on Character or Permanent

cards.

7.4.5.b

This passive ability works while the card is in Hand.

7.4.5.c

When a player plays a card with “Scout X” from Hand, during the
declaration of intent (Rule 5.1.2.c) they may decide to pay X as an alternative cost
instead of the normal Hand cost. If they do, as the card enters the Expedition
zone or the Landmark zone, it simultaneously gains the ability: “h Send me to
Reserve”.
Remark. The ability sending the card to Reserve is a Reaction ability.
Hence, as usual, other Reactions might be resolved before the card goes to
Reserve. Also, other Reactions created as a result of the card entering play
do not disappear when it goes to Reserve.

Example.
Max plays
Aby, Sap Courier
, which is Scout 1.
It also has the ability “j You may Augment target card in play or in
Reserve”. Max may either start by augmenting a card or by sending Aby,
Sap Courier to Reserve, but both effects will resolve in either case.

7.4.5.d

Cost alterations also apply when playing a card with a Scout ability.

85

Remark. While not a cost alteration, it is also possible to play a card
“for free” with Scout. This is a direct consequence of Rule 7.3.20.a,
which does not skip the choice of alternative costs in the declaration of
intent (Rule 5.1.2.c).

7.4.5.e

Reactions of a Character triggered by playing that Character from
Hand with Scout can find the Character in Reserve, even if it is not the object
from which the Reaction originates. This is an exception to Rule 6.3.j.
Example.
Daedalus
has “Scout 1” and the reaction ability “j
Target another Character in play or in Reserve. Then roll a die: On a
4+, we both gain 1 boost / On a 1-3, it gains 1 boost”. If Daedalus is
played with Scout and its owner decides to first move it to Reserve and
then rolls a 4+, then Daedalus will get a boost, even if it is in Reserve and
is therefore not the object from which the Reaction originates. However,
note that if the player first rolls a 4+ and then moves Daedalus to Reserve,
it will lose its boost as it is not Seasoned.

7.4.6
7.4.6.a

Seasoned
Seasoned is a passive ability that appears on Characters.

7.4.6.b

If an object with Seasoned would move from the Expedition zone
to the Reserve, it keeps its boosts as it moves.
Remark. In order to keep its boosts, the former object in the Expedition
zone needs to have Seasoned; the new object in Reserve does not need to
have it.

7.4.6.c

Seasoned applies to any move from the Expedition zone to the
Reserve, including but not limited to the Rest daily effect at Dusk.

7.4.7

Tough
86

7.4.7.a

Tough is a passive ability that appears on Characters and Perma-

nents.

7.4.7.b

Tough is always followed by a number.

7.4.7.c

Tough X means “In order to choose me as a target of an effect they
control, your opponent must also pay X”.

7.4.7.d

A player is never forced to pay a Tough cost, even if all potential
targets have Tough.

7.4.7.e

The choice to pay X is part of the decisions a player makes before
resolving a step.

7.4.7.f

The Tough cost is paid only once per effect, regardless of how many
times the object is chosen as target.
Remark. Previous versions of the rules stated that if a Spell or quick
action was played for free, its controller could choose Tough targets without paying Tough costs while resolving that Spell or quick action. This is
no longer the case as of version 2.0.

7.5

Changes From the Previous Version

In this section are detailed the main changes made to this document between the
previous version, 2.1 (March 4, 2025), and the current version, 3.0 (June 6, 2025).

New Rules
• Augment is a new keyword. It has been added to the glossary and detailed
in Section 7.3.3.
• Scout X is a new keyword. It has been added to the glossary and detailed
in Section 7.4.5. Also, Rule 5.1.2.c now lists “alternative costs”.
• Support abilities can now be reactions or passive abilities (marked by the
I symbol), which is explained in the new Rule 2.2.11.e. It is also listed in
the set of symbols (Rule 1.1.6.j and Section 7.1.5).
• The new keyword actions “double” (counters) and “exchange” (boosts) have
been defined (in Sections 7.3.6 and 7.3.8 respectively).

Rule Changes
The timing to check whether a player wins (or if tiebreakers should start) has
changed: instead of being continuously checked, it now is only checked at the end
of Night, during a new daily effect called Check Victory. This has impacted several
sections of the document:
• Rule 1.3.2.f has been modified to list Check Victory.
• Section 1.3.3 (Ending the Game) has been updated accordingly.
• Section 4.2.5 (Night) has been updated accordingly, in particular detailing
the new Check Victory daily effect.
• Section 4.3 has been renamed from “Ending the Game” to “Tiebreakers”, as
all points not related to tiebreakers were moved to the Check Victory daily
effect. The rules it contains have been updated to take Check Victory into
account.
• Check Victory has been added to the glossary.
• The glossary entries of Clean-up, Daily effect, Night and Tiebreakers have
been updated.

91

Other rule changes:
• During the Clean-up daily effect, landmarks in excess are not discarded but
sacrificed instead. Rules 1.3.2.f and 4.2.5.c have been modified accordingly.
• Tokens leaving the Expedition zone do not join their new zone. Rules 2.1.e
and 7.5.9.b were modified and former Rule 7.5.8.d was removed accordingly.
• Rule 7.3.25.b was added to make it explicit that a sacrifice of which the
discard atomic action has been modified is still a sacrifice.

Other Changes
• Rule 2.1.d has been changed to clarify that it only applies when a card is
moved to a new zone.
• Rules 2.3.1.k and 2.3.1.l have been modified to clarify the re-evaluation process of passive abilities. A remark and an example have also been added
after Rule 2.3.1.l.
• The remark after Rule 4.2.b is more detailed and an example was added.
• Rule 4.2.3.a , stating that there are no daily effects during the Afternoon,
has been added for consistency.
• Former Rule 4.2.5.d about reserve and landmark limits for a player with no
Hero has been split into two rules: 3.2.7.b and 3.2.10.b.
• Rules 5.1.2.d and 5.1.2.e have been moved up to be right after Rule 5.1.2.c
(declaration of intent), as they specify how to determine which costs should
be paid, which should be done during the declaration of intent.
• A remark has been added after Rule 6.1.g to clarify what constitutes an
impossible option.
• Rule 6.3.i has been added to explicitly state what the pronoun “I” refers to
in the effect of a Reaction.
• Rules 7.3.1.a and 7.3.1.b have been updated to reflect the changes made to
Reactions in version 2.0 of this document.
• Rule 7.3.20.a has been made more explicit and now includes all cards.
• Rule 7.4.4.i was added to clarify what joining or leaving a Character’s Expedition means when that Character is Gigantic.
• The glossary entry of Region has been corrected, as it did not list the Arena.
